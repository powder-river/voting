#Voter API

### Overview

This program stores data about a political election into a database and provides and API for users to access information. The API includes information about candidates, voters, and votes.

Structure of the database is present. There are 6 voters, 4 candidates and all voters have voted. Token authentication is also used when necessary. The program needs better tests for the controllers/the tests need to exist. 


####Note:
I used "Ballot" as a class instead of "Vote". I was getting vote and voter mixed up too much so I decided to rename for clarity. Just be aware of that when looking at this code as I'm sure the majority of my peers used Vote.



###Problems
1. Testing: I am finding testing is my biggest weakness and every time we learn a new concept I struggle to find out how to write the test and I always end up working backwards. This was true with the weather API, battleship, and now this assignment as well. I feel once I start to master good test writing, the code writing will make more sense. Testing was the biggest issue for this assignment.

2. authentication token: I understand what the authentication token is, and I was able to piece together a working one from the video, that being said I have zero clue about what is going on and would like to discuss this further

3. Files: minor problem but I feel we spent 90% of our time working on 1-3 files and we made a big jump to the rails file system. I'm getting the hang of it, I feel i just need more exposure to rails to feel comfortable.
